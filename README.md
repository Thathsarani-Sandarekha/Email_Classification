# Email Classification using KNN and Decision Tree

## 1. Introduction

This is a simple classification project that labeling emails as spam or non-spam based on their content in terms of words using two machine learning models based on K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Decision Trees.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset has been taken from UCI Machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase).
